#add(6,7)#calling the function

#A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. It is meant to perform a particular task
#You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function
#A function can return data as a result

#Creating a Function
#In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
#Example

# def add(a,b):
#     return a+b
#
# print(add(9,10))

#calling a function
#to call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
#Example
#add(9,10)

#Arguments
#Information can be passed into functions as arguments
#Example:

# def add(a,b):
#     return a+b

#a and b are arguments. You can add as many arguments as you want, just seperate them with a comma.
#The add function has just two arguments. When the function is called, we pass along values a and b which is used
#inside the fucntion to return addition of a and b
#Arguments are often shortened to args in python documentations

#Parameters or arguments
#The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function

#From a function's perspective: A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the fucntion definition.
#An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called

#Number of arguments
